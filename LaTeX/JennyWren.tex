\begin{verbatim}
Like so many girls
Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart
Took her soul away

Like the other girls
Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world
And it's foolish ways

How, we, spend our days
Casting, love aside
Loosing, site of life
Day, by, day

She saw poverty
Breaking all the home
Wounded warriors
Took her song away

But the day will come
Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world
Mends its foolish ways

Now we, spend our days
Catching, up on life
All because of you
Jenny Wren

--- Dickens McCartney
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Jenny Wren --- whose real name is Fanny Cleaver,
is ''the dolls' dressmaker'' with whom Lizzie lives after her father dies.
She is crippled with a bad back, although not ugly.
She is very motherly towards her drunken father, whom she calls her ''bad child''.
Jenny later cares for Eugene while he recovers from Headstone's attack on his life.
She may have a romance with Sloppy at the end of the book,
which the reader may surmise will end in marriage.
Although her mannerisms give her a certain ''strangeness'', Jenny is very perceptive,
identifying Eugene Wrayburn's intentions towards Lizzie in his small actions.
Her role is a creator and a caretaker, 
and her ''pleasant fancies'' of ''flowers, bird song, numbers of blessed, 
white-clad children'' reflect the mind's ability to rise above adverse 
circumstances --- \textbf{WikiPedia}.
