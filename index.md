Hello!

I am {{ site.author }} from {{ site.address }}.
This page is just humorous intention of fighting the 2020-2021 lockdown boredom.
My apology to 
Charles Dickens
and
Sir Paul McCartney.

Covfefe-19!

## Jenny Wren (Dickens McCartney)

```
Like so many girls
Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart
Took her soul away

Like the other girls
Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world
And it's foolish ways

How, we, spend our days
Casting, love aside
Loosing, site of life
Day, by, day

She saw poverty
Breaking all the home
Wounded warriors
Took her song away

But the day will come
Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world
Mends its foolish ways

Now we, spend our days
Catching, up on life
All because of you
Jenny Wren
```
